<!--
 * Game Lobby Template
 *
 * This template renders the list of players with name input fields and ready buttons,
 * plus the overall game state and the start button. You can add whatever you want inside the 
 * for loop. By using the currentPlayerIndex you can fix each new input to the owning user.
 * I recommend using the given Game/Player class to add options/settings you want to be changeable.
 * If you add more subcollections, you will have to add the observables to use them in the template.
 *
 * NOTES:
 * - The players$ observable is used with the async pipe to get the current player list.
 * - The game$ observable is used similarly to get game metadata like readiness.
 * - You can easily add custom inputs or options inside the player loop (e.g. player-specific settings)
 *   or in the game container (e.g. game-wide settings).
 * - The `currentPlayerIndex` is crucial for controlling which player can edit their name and toggle ready.
 *   Only the current player can interact with their input and button.
 * - The Start button is enabled only for player 0 (host) and only when all players are ready.
 *   You might want to customize who can start the game or add additional conditions here.
 * - At the moment, Player name changes will only be submitted by BLUR not by pressing Enter
 *
 * SIDE NOTE:
 * - I used ngModel and ngModelChange here instead of reactive forms. This decision was made
 *   due to the low complexity of the current form state rendered in the for loop.
