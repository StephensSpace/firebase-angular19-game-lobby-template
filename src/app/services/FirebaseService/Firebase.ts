/**
 * This service uses Angular Firestore to fetch and save data from Firestore.
 * It will provide you every functionality you need to create your Lobby and
 * recieve, update and render your Game data from Firestore.
 * 
 * Key points:
 * - `collectionData` and `docData` return Observable streams that auto-update
 *   whenever the data changes in Firestore. This keeps the UI always in sync.
 * - Some methods are `async` and fetch data just once (Promise-based).
 *   Useful when you don’t need live updates, just a single load.
 * - Other methods return Observables to provide real-time data streams.
 * 
 * Angular Fire Zones:
 * - Firestore calls should run inside Angular Zones to avoid warnings.
 *   These warnings are annoying but don’t break functionality.
 *   This topic is well documented and manageable with AngularFire.
 * 
 * Important note: In Angular 16+, it's recommended **not** to initialize Firebase here.
 * The setup and initialization should instead happen in `app.config.ts`.
