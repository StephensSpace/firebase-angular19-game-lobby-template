/**
 * The Player Object represents a single user in your Lobby/Game.
 * It will be created as a subcollection within a Game document when a Lobby is started.
 * You might want to costumize here and add more Userdata needed in your application.
 * 
 * Each player slot gets initialized with default values. 
 * These can later be updated by user actions (e.g. selecting a name or color).
 * 
 * NOTE:
 * - In the current state of the template, the 'color' field is unused.
 *   You can safely remove it if you don't plan to use player colors.
 * - 'ready' becomes true when the player clicks their Ready button.
 * - 'inLobby' is a helper flag to mark if the player has actually joined.
 *    Used to check if Slot is occupied.
 * - 'id' is the number of the player in the Lobby, starting from 0.
 *   It is generated automatically in a for-loop according to maxPlayers.
 * - 'name' defaults to "Player" and should be updated by user input.
 * - Extend this object if you need more Player metadata (avatar, ping, host flag etc.).
